some move test cases...


for valid move:
- satisfies vertical colour/symbol
- satisfies horizontal colour/symbol
- doesn't already exist in vertical/horizontal 6
- when connecting two verticals or two horizontals, the row/column rules must be satisfied after conjoining
    -no doubling symbols
    -overarching rule satisfied for whole row (colour or symbol)

invalid moves will also include:
- attempting to place piece that isn't in hand
- attempting to place piece on square that isn't on board
- attempting to place piece on square that is occupied

logic >>
discovering rules:
colour is valid if all in a direction are a certain colour
symbol is valid if all in a direction are a certain symbol
eg. placing next to a single tile both colour an symbol are valid
eg2. placing next to a string of tiles only colour or symbol will be valid

as soon as invalid is called; logic should break and simply return invalid

place 'tile' at 'index' validity check
if (!exist in hand)
    invalid
if(!'index' exist on board)
    invalid
if('index' currently occupied)
    invalid
if(not adjacent to existing tile && after turn 1)
    invalid

for(N, E, S, W)
    if(existsCurrentDirection == true)
        discover rule for current direction
    if('tile' !satisfy rule)
        invalid
    if ('tile' already exists in current direction)
        invalid

for(N and E)
    if(existsCurrentDirection == true && existsOppositeDirection == true)
        discover rule for current direction
        discover rule for opposite direction
        if(ruleCurrent != ruleOpposite)
            invalid
        if(any tile in current direction exists in opposite direction)
            invalid
