some move test cases...


for valid move:
- satisfies vertical colour/symbol
- satisfies horizontal colour/symbol
- doesn't already exist in vertical/horizontal 6
- when connecting two verticals or two horizontals, the row/column rules must be satisfied after conjoining
   -no doubling symbols
   -overarching rule satisfied for whole row (colour or symbol)

invalid moves will also include:
- attempting to place piece that isn't in hand
- attempting to place piece on square that isn't on board
- attempting to place piece on square that is occupied

place R1 at L12  - valid // satisfies vertical colour
place R2 at L12  - invalid // can't double up in the same 6
place B4 at J10  - invalid // can't double up in the same 6
place G5 at I13  - valid // satisfies vertical and horizontal and rules maintained upon conjoining
place G3 at I13  - invalid // satisfies vertical but not horizontal
place Y5 at I13  - invalid // satisfies horizontal but not vertical
place B1 at N15  - invalid // satisfies left and right, but upon conjoining, rule for the 6 is broken - colour/symbol
place B5 at P19  - invalid // satisfies up and down, but upon conjoining, rule for the 6 is broken - repetition


logic >>
discovering rules:
colour is valid if all in a direction are a certain colour
symbol is valid if all in a direction are a certain symbol
eg. placing next to a single tile both colour an symbol are valid
eg2. placing next to a string of tiles only colour or symbol will be valid

as soon as invalid is called; logic should break and simply return invalid

place 'tile' at 'index' validity check
if (!exist in hand)
   invalid
if(!'index' exist on board)
   invalid
if('index' currently occupied)
   invalid

update variables existsN, existsE, existsS, existsW
if(existsN, existsE, existsS, existsW all == false)
      invalid

for(N, E, S, W)
      if(existsCurrentDirection == true)
         discover rule for current direction
      if('tile' !satisfy rule)
         invalid
      if ('tile' already exists in current direction)
         invalid

for(N and E)
   if(existsCurrentDirection == true && existsOppositeDirection == true)
      discover rule for current direction
      discover rule for opposite direction
      if(ruleCurrent != ruleOpposite)
         invalid
      if(any tile in current direction exists in opposite direction)
         invalid
